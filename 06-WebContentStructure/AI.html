  <h2>AI Definition</h2>
  <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development
    of computer systems that can perform tasks typically
    requiring human intelligence. These tasks include
    problem-solving, understanding natural language,
    recognizing patterns, and making decisions.
    
    AI is a broad field that encompasses various subfields
    and techniques, such as machine learning, natural
    language processing, robotics, and computer vision.</p>

  <h2>Examples of AI in Daily Life</h2>
  <p>AI is used as voice assistants. Siri, Google Assistant,
    and Alexa use AI to understand and respond to voice
    commands. Platforms like Netflix and Amazon use AI to
    recommend products or shows based on your previous
    interactions. AI enables self-driving cars to navigate
    roads and make driving decisions.</p>
  <p>The data in the table shows four main areas of AI application:
    natural language processing, computer vision, machine learning,
    and reinforcement learning. Each area is related to a specific application,
    such as chatbots, medical image analysis systems, or autonomous vehicles.
    These applications have a significant impact on various sectors,
    improving the efficiency of customer service, medical diagnostics,
    protection against financial fraud, and the development of modern
    technologies such as self-driving cars.</p>

  <h2>The Future of AI</h2>
  <p>AI continues to grow and impact various fields such as
    healthcare, education, finance, and manufacturing.
    However, ethical considerations, such as job
    displacement, privacy concerns, and AI safety, are also
    key topics of discussion. The development of AI is
    likely to reshape many industries and aspects of daily
    life in the years to come.</p>

  <h2>Key Concepts in AI</h2>
  <p>In relation to artificial intelligence,
    the following key concepts can be distinguished:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI
      that allows systems to learn from data and improve
      over time without being explicitly programmed.
      Examples include recommendation systems (like
      Netflix or YouTube) and fraud detection.</li>
    <li>Natural Language Processing (NLP): A branch of AI
      focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret,
      and generate human language. Applications include voice
      assistants like Siri or Alexa, chatbots, and language
      translation systems.</li>
    <li>Computer Vision: Enables machines to interpret
      and make decisions based on visual data from the world,
      such as images and videos. It's widely used in facial
      recognition, self-driving cars, and medical imaging.</li>
    <li>Robotics: AI powers robots, giving them the ability
      to perform tasks autonomously, often in environments
      that are too dangerous or complex for humans.</li>
    <li>Expert Systems: AI-based systems designed to mimic
      human expertise in specific domains, such as medical
      diagnosis or financial decision-making.</li>
  </ol>
